# PE01 - My Resume

## Input

The input consists of personal and professional details, including Personal Information, Education, Skills, Work Experience and Projects

## Process

The app is built using React components. The App.js component renders the Resume.js component, which contains all the resume data. The Resume.js component organizes the data
 into distinct sections: personal information, education, skills, work experience, and projects. These sections are displayed using HTML elements, with each section styled 
 using the Resume.css file. The data is hardcoded in the Resume.js file for simplicity.

## Output

The output is a styled resume displayed in the browser. The page features a background color of rgba(#bdfb04), with the content centered and divided into sections. 
Each section has a clear heading, and the text is formatted for readability. Hyperlinks are provided for project repositories, which open in new tabs when clicked. The 
result is a clean, well-organized resume that highlights the user's qualifications and work experience.
